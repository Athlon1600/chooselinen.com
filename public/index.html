        My name is Egle. I was born and raised in Lithuania, a country with traditions of growing and processing flax
        dating back a few thousand years.
      </p>

      <p>
        I immigrated to the United States almost two decades ago, where I lived in the Chicagoland area for years before
        finally moving to Florida. Sewing has always been my #1 hobby and passion even though, ironically, none of my
        education, career, or jobs were ever related to sewing, textiles, of designing. I am self taught through years
        of making clothes and other sewing projects for myself, my family, and friends. It is only recently that I
        finally decided to offer my products to others on Etsy.

        From all the variety of fabrics, linen is my favorite - I love every little wrinkle of it! My love for it only
        gets stronger as I keep learning about its amazing qualities. My shop is “one man band” as all my patterns are
        made by me and all my garments are also sewn by me in the sewing room of my home in Florida. Simple, plain,
        minimalistic, comfortable, pure and eco-friendly is how I would describe my designs.
      </p>

      <p>
        For those of you who are already in love with linen: I don’t need to add anything further. And for those whose
        skin has never experienced linen touch: I invite you to discover it!
